## Node Modules Installation Guidelines

The `.gitignore` file in this project is configured to prevent the `node_modules` folder from being pushed to the repository.

**Before running any project, make sure to install the required node modules by running the following command in your project directory:**

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.
